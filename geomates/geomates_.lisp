;;;
;;; clone of the 'geometry friends' competition
;;;
;;; This clone provides socket connections to agents and a web browser for GUI (graphics output only so far).
;;; World simulation is performed using a dynamic library that wraps calls to the box2d library (which only comes as static
;;; library, unfortunately). You need to build the wrapper library and add the path to your library at the beginning of this file.
;;; Be sure to leave existing "probe-files" untouched so this program will work in different environments. 
;;; Agent and GUI connect to the ports defined above. You may change the ports as you like. The assignment of agents
;;; to disc and rect player is performed randomly; each agent is informed which player it controls.
;;; Agents interact with the game by sending simple text data via the TCP/IP socket connection:
;;; a : move left
;;; d : move right
;;; w : jump (disc player only)
;;; w : strech horizontally (rect player only)
;;; s : compress horizonztally (rect player only)
;;; q : request to quit this level (quitting only occurs when both agents have requested to quit)
;;; m(...) : send message (...) in KIF format, i.e., a symbolic expression to other agent
;;;
;;; You can use "telnet" in the command line to connect to the game server and play an agent yourself.
;;; To this end, the game server sends some commands (according to RFC 854) to connected agent/terminal that
;;; switch a telnet client into byte mode in order to send a packet immediately after a key is pressed.
;;; In your agent implementation you should therefore ignore the first 6 bytes received in case your
;;; agent gets confused with receiving non-printable characters. Sending the telnet commands can be
;;; disabled in "await-agent-connections", but then you would need to configure telnet each time manually
;;; to switch to byte mode first in order to use it.
;;;
;;; Levels are defined in a global variable *levels* as list of levels. Each level consists out of objects
;;; given as s-expressions. The coordinate system is x to the right, positive  is up. Unit size is meter.
;;; Levels should be 80 x 40 in size to fit the graphical output. 
;;; Format and semantics are as follows:
;;; (:rect x y) starting position of the rect, the rect player starts with initial width according to +rect-length+ (2m)
;;; (:disc x y) starting position of the disc, the disc is of radius +disc-radius+ (1.0m)
;;; (:platform x1 y1 x2 y2) defines a rectangular platform with corners (x1 y1) and (x2 y2)
;;;                         be nice and add a ground plane and side walls to avoid your players falling off accidentally
;;; (:diamond x y) diamond to collect: each level must contain at least one diamand as a level is said to be finished if
;;;                no diamonds are left
;;;
